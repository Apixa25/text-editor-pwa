## Description üìù
This project is a Text Editor with a beautiful color interface.  It can be used to take notes or save code snippets with or without an internet connection.  

This project is a progressive web app (PWA).  A PWA is a type of web application that utilizes modern web technologies to provide an app-like experience for users. One of the things that make PWA‚Äôs special is that they can work with varying levels of network connectivity, including offline mode. They use service workers to cache important resources and provide a reliable user experience even when the device is offline or has a poor network connection.  This App utilizes this and even has an ‚Äúinstall‚Äù feature so that the user can install the Text Editor directly to their machine and be able to use it completely offline.

## Learning Points üßë‚Äçüè´

  
To create this application, I used:

1. IndexedDB (via the idb package) as a database.  idb is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexDB API.  
2. Webpack to bundle front-end code
3. Workbox to create a service worker that caches static assets
And, Heroku.
